# Incorrect State Update in React useEffect Hook

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `useEffect` hook in React.  The code attempts to directly modify the `count` state variable within the `useEffect` callback, which is incorrect.  React's state updates must be done via the state setter function provided by the `useState` hook (in this case, `setCount`). Direct manipulation won't trigger a re-render, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation.  The `count` variable is incremented directly, causing the component to not update properly.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct implementation. The `setCount` function is used to update the state, ensuring that React correctly updates the UI and triggers a re-render.
